CMake Deprecation Warning:
  Support for "Extra Generators" like

    CodeBlocks

  is deprecated and will be removed from a future version of CMake.  IDEs may
  use the cmake-file-api(7) to view CMake-generated project build trees.


CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/pcl/PCLConfig.cmake:146 (find_package):
  Policy CMP0144 is not set: find_package uses upper-case <PACKAGENAME>_ROOT
  variables.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0144" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  CMake variable EIGEN_ROOT is set to:

    /usr/include/eigen3

  For compatibility, find_package is ignoring the variable, but code in a
  .cmake module might still use it.
